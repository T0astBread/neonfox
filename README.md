# neonfox
Dark theme with vibrant colors for FireFox

## Installation
1. Install the Add-on like you would normally

If you also want the monospace font (or any font you like if you know CSS):

2. Open `about:profiles`
3. Click `Open Directory` in the `Root Directory` column of the default profile
4. Create a folder called `chrome`, if not already present
5. Copy the `userChrome.css` file into the newly created folder
6. Restart FireFox (pro tip: use `about:restartrequired` - it preserves your tabs)
